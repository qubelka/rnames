# RNames

RNames is a relational database linking stratigraphic names with each other that are considered to be time-equivalent or time-overlapping.

Each link in the database is drawn from a published reference and is considered as an expressed opinion. The sum of published opinions can be used to correlate a certain name with another name and ultimately to bin within a certain time frame. This is what this database is for.
